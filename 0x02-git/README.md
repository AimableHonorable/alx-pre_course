# Getting familiar with git and github
## So far I can do a lot with git such as:
* Creating git account
* Creating git repository
* Adding a remote repository to the local directory
* Commiting and pushing to the remote repository
* Fetching changes from remote repository
* Creating branch and changing the branch to use
